# FrozenLake RL Agent

This repository contains the code for a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that plays the popular FrozenLake game using the gymnasium toolkit. The objective of the game is for the agent to navigate through a frozen lake and reach the goal while avoiding falling into any holes. The RL agent uses the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal policies through trial and error.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python 3, jupyter notebook and the gymnasium toolkit installed.

`pip3 install notebook`
`pip3 install "gymnasium[all]"`

## Usage

The main file for the FrozenLake game is frozen_lake.ipynb.

The agent will then begin learning and playing the game. You can adjust the parameters of the Q-learning algorithm and the game environment in the frozen_lake.ipynb file.

## Results

The RL agent has been trained using the Q-learning algorithm to achieve high scores in the FrozenLake game. You can find the results and analysis of the agent's performance in the results.txt file.
